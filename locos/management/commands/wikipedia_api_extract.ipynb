It had a total projected length of 66 miles but never reached [[Barnsley]], stopping a few miles short at [[Stairfoot]]. The name was changed to \\'\\'\\'The Hull and Barnsley Railway\\'\\'\\' (\\'\\'\\'H&BR\\'\\'\\') in 1905. Its [[Alexandra Dock, Hull|Alexandra Dock]] in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] opened 16 July 1885.\\n\\nThe main line ran from Hull to [[Cudworth, South Yorkshire|Cudworth]], with two other lines branching off at Wrangbrook Junction, the [[South Yorkshire Junction Railway]] to Denaby, and [[The Hull & South Yorkshire Extension Railway]], an eight-mile branch to [[Wath-upon-Dearne]], opened 31 March 1902. The company also had joint running powers on the [[Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway]] (Gowdall and Braithwell Railway).\\n\\nBefore the [[Railways Act 1921|Grouping]] of 1923, the line was taken over by the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] (NER). Following incorporation into the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER), duplicated infrastructure was closed or reduced in function – notably [[Cannon Street railway station, Hull|Cannon Street station]] and the Springhead Locomotive Works.\\n\\nClosure of the greater part of the main line itself came during the time of British Railways. As of 2011 the elevated line in Hull with some of the extensions and alterations added by the NER and LNER are still in use and referred to as the \\'\\'\\'Hull Docks Branch\\'\\'\\' and has the [[Engineer\\'s Line Reference]] of HJS.{{#tag:ref|HJS \"\\'\\'Hessle Road Junction to Saltend\\'\\'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaycodes.org.uk/elrs/elrh.shtm| title = Engineer\\'s Line References (ELRs) : Codes beginning H| work=www.railwaycodes.org.uk/elrs/elrh.shtm|first=Phil |last=Deaves|at= HJS|access-date=15 April 2014}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}}\\n\\n==Background==\\nBy the 19th century the coalfields of southern Yorkshire were producing large amounts of coal, the industrialised midland region was making manufactured goods, and the new industrial towns of the West Riding of Yorkshire and of Lancashire were producing cloth and other goods. Thus opportunities for trade, export and profit existed along the east coast of England as well as along the Humber and the tributary rivers feeding it.\\n\\nGoole had risen from nothing as a port on the Ouse with the creation of the Knottingley to Goole Canal in 1826 by the [[Aire and Calder Navigation|Aire and Calder Canal Company]]; the port, built to generous specifications rapidly gained inward and outward trade – much to the chagrin of Hull, and spurred the development of the extension of the [[Leeds and Selby Railway]] to Hull which opened in 1840.{{sfn|Gillett|MacMahon|1980|loc= Chapter 21 \"Railways\"|p= 271}} Additionally the North Eastern Railway – which had a monopoly on rail transport to Hull – prevented other rail companies investing there, and so Goole gained its own railway by the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway (later part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway) in 1848. A custom-built railway dock and the use of specialised coal barges and unloading facilities, as well as the backing of the Aire and Calder Canal company, made it a very viable competitor to Hull for trade.{{sfn|Ellis|Crowther|1990|loc= Chapter 23 \"The rise and decline of Goole as a Humber port\", (J. D. Porteus)|pp=321–325}}\\n\\nAdditionally, as a competitor to the port of Hull (and equally well placed for European trade), Grimsby began to grow after the 1840s when the Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway Company built a rail connection, and the Royal Dock was completed in 1852.{{sfn|Ellis|Crowther|1990|loc= Chapter 17 \"The historical development of Grimsby and Cleethorpes\", (R. W. Ambler)| pp= 236–240}}\\n\\nHull had expanded rapidly during the 18th century with shipping tonnages increasing over ten times in that period, and numerous docks supplementing and connecting Old Dock (Queen\\'s Dock) being built by the Dock company in the 19th: Humber Dock 1809, Junction Dock (Prince\\'s Dock) 1829, by 1846 Railway Dock connected to the [[Hull and Selby Railway]] (later part of the NER), as well as Victoria Dock (1850), Albert Dock (1869) and St Andrews Dock (1883).<ref name=\"yc\">{{harvnb|Lewis|1991|loc= Chapter 11 \"Ports and Harbours\", (M.J.T.

Additionally, being built after the [[Railway Mania]] of the 1840s it had to cross numerous already existent lines in southern Yorkshire. Over one hundred bridges were required,<ref name=\"bridge7\">{{harvnb|Stokes|1885}}</ref> with over 20 within the urban area of Hull alone.<ref group=\"note\">C.T. Goode in \\'\\'Railways of Hull\\'\\' quotes a figure of \\'\\'35 within the town boundary\\'\\' (undated), whilst G.D. Parkes (\\'\\'The Hull and Barnsley Railway\\'\\') notes  \\'\\'nine substantial underline bridges ... in the first four miles\\'\\'. A survey using [[Ordnance Survey]] maps of the period shows that there were more than 20 within the urbanised area. Later developments in Hull led to the construction or alteration of further bridges.</ref>\\n[[File:Hull And Barnsley River Hull Bridge.jpg|River Hull Bridge|thumb]]\\n\\nThe majority (eighty eight) of the bridges were of plate girder construction with usually three plate sides (one central) supporting cross-beams on which the track was supported. For longer spans a girder \"N\" truss design was used<ref name=\"bridge7\"/><ref group=\"note\">A close variation or example of the [[Pratt truss]]</ref> These larger bridges incorporate rollers on one end to allow for the thermal expansion of the bridge.<ref name=\"bridge7\"/> For other long spans, and for the two swing bridges on the line (Ouse and Hull bridges), open girder truss of approximately parabolic shape (open truss bowstring) were used. Both swing bridges were manufactured by [[Andrew Handyside and Company|Messrs. Handyside of Derby]].<ref name=\"bridge7\"/>\\n\\nIn addition to wrought iron bridges, brick arches were also used, both for crossing small dykes and country lanes, as well as the abutments to bridges and in place of embankments on short sections between bridges.\\n\\nAt Beverley Road, Willerby & Kirk Ella, North Cave and Wallingfen were two-storey buildings with the upper storey accessing the embanked track.<ref name=\"stat1\">{{harvnb|Bairstow|1990| p= 59}}</ref> Stations were built in the English Queen Anne revival style – with decorative external brick courses between floors and brick lintels; minor embellishments on other brick structures such as bridge buttresses roughly echoed the same style.\\n\\nIn July 1884 work stopped for 5 months,<ref name=\"constr2\"/> through a failure to raise funds through a share issue to pay the workers. Parliament allowed the additional debts to be taken for the work to continue, by completion the total share issue was £6,000,000 and the loans £3,500,000.<ref name=\"money1\"/> At this point the line was almost complete but the subsequent cost cutting meant that the planned grand terminus close to the centre of Hull was never built.\\n\\n===Description of the Line and assets===\\n\\n====Hull to Springhead====\\n[[File:Hull RJD 37.JPG|thumb|1914 Railway map of Hull]]\\nMuch of the assets of the \\'\\'\\'Hull Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company\\'\\'\\' lay in Hull.<ref group=\"note\">The term \\'junction\\' in the company\\'s name means that it was a line that connected at a railway junction, rather than reaching a destination such as a major city; this junction (or junctions) lay at the Barnsley end of the line, meaning that there was relatively little infrastructure at that end.</ref> The line terminated in Hull at three main points: \\'\\'\\'[[Alexandra Dock, Hull|Alexandra Dock]]\\'\\'\\'; for import and export of goods by sea, \\'\\'\\'[[Hull Cannon Street railway station|Cannon Street station]]\\'\\'\\' (a goods station and also the passenger terminus), and \\'\\'\\'Neptune Street goods station\\'\\'\\', the main goods terminus.\\n\\nThe HB&WRJR&DCo\\'s main asset was Alexandra Dock.

Two [[graving dock]]s, one {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, the other a little bigger were also built at the north-east corner of the dock.

Next was a minor goods yard situated at Burleigh Street, then the Foredyke Stream (a drainage canal) and the NER\\'s [[Hull and Hornsea Railway|Hull to Hornsea Line]] were crossed close together. The line then crossed the River Hull at the Hull Bridge, and then branches (from the down direction) serving Sculcoates goods yard (southward) and the British Gas Light Company\\'s gas works (northward). Westward from Sculcoates goods yard a spur ran backwards to serve Hull Corporation\\'s own electricity power plant (opened 1895<ref>{{cite book| title = The Railways of Hull and East Yorkshire|first= Michael|last= Thompson|publisher= Hutton Press|year= 1992|page= 20}}</ref>).
