        written an extensive, but not authorative, biography of Fowler which concentrates
        excessively on his many, and varied, external activities, rather than on
        his great contribution as an engineer: partly because the Author has clearly
        failed to read what Sir Henry wrote and spoke about. </small><br>
        <small><a href="/web/20230516165310/https://www.steamindex.com/imecheng/proc1920.htm#113-723">Fowler's Presidential Address
        to the IMechE in 1927 </a>should be read by all who have sought to assess
        both Sir Henry's and George Stephenson's stature as engineers :it may also
        imply much on the gross incompetance of the management of the LMS that such
        a great engineer became entwined in an environment which failed to perceive
        this and encourage its development. On the LNER Whitelaw ensured that a
        comparable man of genius, Gresley, developed his full potential in spite
        of a far weaker corporate financial structure.<br>
        <a href="/web/20230516165310/https://www.steamindex.com/library/ellis.htm#ellmid">Ellis in his book on the <i>Midland
        Railway</i></a> brought into question the extent to which locomotives could
        be attributed to specific engineers. Firstly, he cited James Holden of the
        Great Eastern "who was an excellent man for carriages". His most famous
        locomotive designs, including the Claud Hamiltons and the great Decapod,
        were made for him by the late Fred V. Russell, who also produced the Great
        Eastern 4-6-0s officially ascribed to Stephen Holden. Ellis then stated:
        "What all this is leading up to is the question of whether H Fowler of the
        Midland ever designed a locomotive. He is reported as having once said, after
        dining, that he never did such a thing in his life. Only two really new designs
        appeared from Derby during the last years of the Midland Railway, one a banking
        engine for the .Lickey incline, and the other a heavy goods for the Somerset
        and Dorset." The Ellis remark is liable to be misunderstood: firstly the
        "after dining" might imply inebriation, but Fowler was a teetotaller, and
        secondly it might be thought that he was totally uninterested in locomotive
        design and this was obviously not the case: indeed one suspects that no other
        mechanical engineer was as interested in locomotives, especially their boilers,
        as Sir Henry.. </small><br>
        <small>Fowler's qualities as a mechanical engineer were vastly greater than
        those of Collett, and one can be certain that like Webb, Fowler has suffered
        from glib assessments. <a href="#pap457">Cox's paper to the Institution of

  <small>A discussion meeting chaired by Sir Henry Fowler. Concluding, Sir
  Henry welcomed the pertinent points raised by Dr. Kapp. There were many points
  with regard to the criticism of steam and electric locomotives which might
  be dealt with if there was time, but the consideration they wanted to lay
  hold upon was whether it was going to pay to electrify our main lines. There
  was no insuperable electrical or mechanical difficulty in the electrification
  of main lines, but there was a difficulty in regard to the financial side
  of the problem when they were dealing with a low density of traffic. He would
  again quote his friend, Mr. A.W. Gibbs, who said the difficulties were more
  mechanical than electrical. The electrical side of the problem seemed to
  be perfectly sound. There were certain mechanical difficulties. One of them,
  unfortunately, had not been touched upon, that was the question of low centre
  of gravity and wheel arrangement.</small>

  <small>Sir Henry opened the discussion with some rather penetrating comments:26
  years ago, his then chief, Samuel Johnson, sent him to look at a boiler in
  London whicli vas fired by pulverised fuel, having in his mind the question
  of its adaptation for locomotive purposes. There was trouble with this boiler,
  owing to the fact that thc basic slag, which was formed badly, corroded the
  firebrick which lay in the furnace–this is a trouble with all boilers
  using pulverised fuel, although Armstrong has not mentioned it. In one of
  the boilers which he had seen in Germany using pulverised fuel, very little
  firebrick was used, but hr believed the difficulty had been met by arranging
  a very large number of burners vhich gave a short flame. One of the greatest
  difficulties in introducing powdered fuel in connection with electric light
  plants has been due to this particular point, even uhen some of the combustion
  chambers were of very large size. The difficulty experienced with a powdered
  fuel 1ocomotive used in America was similar and overcome by the use of very
  short flames. </small><br>

  <small>said it was a matter of some difficulty to discuss a Paper of this
  kind, but he felt that the presentation of it was of very great advantage,
  more particularly to the junior members of the Institution interested in
  locomotive work. The Paper gave in a concise form what he thought Lieut.-Colonel
  Kitson Clark would agree with him would take a lifetime under ordinary conditions
  to get together. He was placed in somewhat of a difficulty because he had
  not quite appreciated whether the Author had proposed to bring forward the
  difficulties which he had experienced with locomotives built in accordance
  with English and American practice, or whether he proposed to discuss the
  differences in locomotive practice in these two countries. He raised two
  points which were always in the minds of locomotive engineers when dealing
  with design in thiscountry-the loading gauge and the weight on the bridges.
  Those things did not press to anything like the same extent in America that
  they did here. As far as the bridges were concerned, the Author said it was
  quite an easy matter to deal with the question of bridges if the money saved
  in using larger and heavier locomotives was capitalized. He himself had travelled
  lengths of 200 or 300 miles on various lines in America, going over perhaps
  a dozen bridges across streams but practically never a bridge over a public
  road. Engineers in this country were constantly meeting the difliculty of
  bridges over roads. With reference to the use of ten-wheel engines, the Midland
  Railway, of which he was the Chief Mechanical Engineer, was the only one
  that had a ten-wheel coupled engine running on a main line, and in a distance
  of two and a half miles that railway ran over road bridges-not large bridges-and
  the locomotive had to be designed to suit those particular bridges. It was
  a point to consider that in this country the number of bridges were intense
  and immense. With regard to wagons, the question of increasing their size
  was always in the minds of railway engineers in this country. The remedy
  largely lay with the owners of wharves and coal screens, etc. Taking the
  capital value of making the necessary alterations, it would be found to be
  an immense sum. The first President of the Institution, George Stephenson,
  was such an artistic man that he put a little crown or ragged piece of tin
  work on the top of the “Rocket,” probably, but for this the head-room
  would now be even less. It was only possible to touch very lightly on the
  details of the Paper, and practically speaking an evening might be devoted
  to almost every one of the points mentioned, and several evenings on those
  not mentioned. The question of outside cylinders was an important one, and
  the Author showed that they were practically universal in American locomotives.
  In the majority of Colonial countries there were no platforms. One of the
  things with which the railway engineer had to contend in outside cylinders
  was coming within the gauge. Every engineer would like to have a larger boiler,
  and he advocated very strongly that the best way to burn coal was to burn
  it fairly slowly, not intensely, not with a blast that carried a very large
  proportion of the fuel through the tubes into the smokebox- if it went no
  further-and there again came up the question of weight. He held that there
  was no more efficient way of using steam in a locomotive than in using it
  in a compound and with superheat. The question of basic versus acid steel
  he felt was not a question of basic or acid, but a question of how the basic
  steel was made. If an engineer could be perfectly satisfied with the way
  in which it was made, there was no difficulty at all in using basic steel
  for any purpose, and the way in which it was made included of course the
  material. He would like to satisfy Colonel Kitson Clark with regard to the
  question of how basic steel could be flanged. On the railway with which he
  was connected, they had recently taken a plate shaped somewhat as shown in
  Fig. 12, the distance at A being 45 inches. It was not a thick plate but
  it was flanged into a splasher with quite a sharp corner, and the distance
  at B was 16 inches. He thought that should be conclusive proof that there
  was no difficulty in flanging basic steel. The thickness undoubtedly made
  a difference. They were able to flange the cross-stays and other parts made
  of basic steel up to 2 inch in thickness, with ease.<br>
  With regard to the use of copper and steel in fire-boxes and tubes, he had
  just had an opportunity of seeing about half a dozen steel boxes which were
  put in during the War, and he stated without hesitation that he did not wish
  to use steel fire-boxes on his railway. It might be that it was the condition
  in which the coal was burned or the coal itself, but the whole of the lower
  portion of the boxes would have to be scrapped much earlier than they would
  have been, had they been copper. With regard to the erosion which took place
  in copper tubes, he could say from an experience of between 2,000 and 3,000
  locomotives that there was no difficulty at all, but when his Company and
  certain other companies used brass tubes there was considerable erosion just
  inside the tube-plate with certain coals. His Company had used during the
  War a large number of steel tubes, but replaced them as soon as ever an
  opportunity occurred, the reason being that the copper tubes gave infinitely
  less trouble. He had gone through month by month the casualties due to leaky
  tubes, and in spite of the fact that there were three times as many copper
  tubes in service as there were steel tubes, he thought the casualties were
  ten to one on the other way round. With reference to fusible plugs, the Americans
  had evidently considered the matter of sufficient importance to get the National
  Bureau of Standards to make an investigation into the subject. He knew it
  was not universally held amongst his colleagues in this country that a fusible
  plug was exactly the right thing. Such a plug must be properly made and looked
  after, and he thought even if a fusible plug had anything happen to it, at
  all events the attention of the firemen was called to the fact that there
  was something happening. Since the Midland Railway had adopted the principle
  of filling the plugs, and re-heating them in a muffle to just above the melting
  point of lead, the difficulties had disappeared. The Author also dealt with
  the somewhat complicated question of the superheater elements and the headers.
  On the Midland they used with advantage a copper ring of diamond section
  fitted into grooves both in the header and in the collar on the superheater
  element. He thought there was a great advantage in a loose flange over a
  fixed flange which rigidly connected the superheater elements as used in
  many cases. The shrinkage of tyres mentioned by the Author was employed by
  certain railway companies. The allowance given by the Author was 1/750, whereas
  his company employed 1/1100. That was very largely dependent on the finish
  obtained on the tyre and the centre. On a rough centre a greater shrinkage
  was required than with a smooth one. When his predecessor came back from
  America some years ago, he was very delighted with the system of lubrication
  in which a mixture of waste and horsehair was used. It was given an extended
  trial, but there was difficulty from the fact that the horse-hair tended
  to get into the oil channels and curl up into small balls.<br>
  With regard to oil consumption, in this country, with mechanical lubricators
  under the axle-boxes, it had been possible to reduce the consumption 66 per
  cent on what the Author mentioned. He was in the position of having to look
  after not only Belpaire boilers, and boilers with roof bars, but also round-top
  boilers with direct stays, and he was just dealing with the question of replacing
  direct-stayed boilers with boilers of the Belpaire type</small><br>

  <small><b>Sir Henry Fowler (662-3) </b>said that, having been the first observer
  of a steam-driven lorry which went out on official trial in this country,
  at which trials he had the pleasure of meeting a prominent Member of the
  Council, he could not help looking back and seeing the great developments
  which had taken place in these vehicles since that time. He had been particularly
  interested in what the Author had said with regard to electric vehicles,
  because he represented a firm which had, he believed, the largest fleet of
  this type of motors in the country, which they found extremely useful for
  town deliveries. He was sorry the figures which he could put forward, and
  which had been published quite recently in <i>Motor Transport</i>, could
  not be compared with those the Author had given, because the latter had evidently
  been chosen from typical heavy working under good conditions of loading;
  these conditions were one of the great essentials for getting the best service
  not only out of steam-vehicles but any type of motor, and one which railway
  companies had very gwat difficulty in finding. In view of the constant changes
  in the rates paid for labour at the present time it would add materially
  to the usefulness of the Paper if the Author would state, in reference to
  the figures given on page 642, the date to which these figures applied, as
  this would be of use for future reference.<br>
  With regard to the life of vehicles, his firm purchased two motor vans in
  1903 which had only just been disposed of, although for a very considerable
  time they ran for twenty hours out of the twenty-four. They had a few
  steam-vehicles, one of which had already had a life of sixteen or seventeen
  years. A tractor built at Lincoln had a life of about ten years and was still
  working satisfactorily. One point which had not been touched upon, but which
  was of vital interest from a warehousing standpoint, was the fire risk with
  steam-vehicles. That subject had received much greater consideration of late
  years than in earlier times, but it was a factor which militated against
  the use of steam-vehicles under certain conditions. He was sorry that from
  a purely railway standpoint he could not discuss the question which the Author
  had touched upon in the early part of his Paper in the time at present at
  his disposal. It must be remembered, however, that motor-vehicles at present
  ran on a permanent way–the roads–which was practically speaking
  free. He lived on the side of a main road between two cities about 60 miles
  apart, and he knew the difficulty he experienced in using a push-bicycle
  over that road at the present time, and more so with a fairly light car on
  four wheels. Undoubtedly this question of roads was a subject which must
  be handled before the motor-vehicle could be satisfactorily dealt with on
  the lines suggested by the Author, as many of the roads were at present in
  a disgraceful state. Until a central authority was established, the roads
  would not be put into a condition in which they could be used for steam or
  petrol traction to the greatest advantage, and the question naturally arose
  as to who was to pay for this. He did not wish to discuss the question of
  the new taxation of vehicles, but he thought it would hardly meet the state
  of things which the Author laid down as likely to occur in the future.</small>

  <small> </small><a name="24"><small>Sir Henry Fowler
  (24-5)</small></a><small>: I agree with Mr. Maunsell that the Paper we have
  heard requires a great deal of discussion and also a great deal of thought.
  To begin with, in the first part of the Paper reference is made to the question
  of a corrugated firebox, and no doubt the Author will remember that the Jacob
  box of the Santa Fé Railroad of America was on the same principle,
  but for various reasons it has been abandoned. In the box with which Mr Wagner
  is experimenting, I am rather doubtful whether trouble may not be experienced
  owing to the "breathing' which must take place in the corrugations. Something
  will probably also depend upon the class of water used, and I think difficulties
  may arise with water which gives a hard china-like scale which might crack
  along the corrugation and lead to subsequent corrosion.</small>
  </p><p align="Justify">
  <small>With regard to the interesting proposal of increasing the number of
  superheater elements in the smoke tubes, I would point out that one railway
  in England has adopted for many years elements comprised of six small tubes
  in each superheater flue tube as against the normal arrangement. On the old
  Midland Railway, we have tested an engine so fitted, but it did not meet
  with the success we had hoped.</small>
  </p><p>
  <small>Coming to the main point of the Paper, which refers to the proportions
  of the tubes, one can compare the suggestion of Mr. Wagner of area of free
  space to area of surface of tube with that of Mr. Lawford Fry, who has, as
  is well known, done such a great work on the proportions of the ordinary
  boiler tubes, and who advocates that the ratio between the diameter of a
  tube and its length should not exceed 1 to 100, and it is interesting to
  note that in the case of a plain boiler tube, if the ratio A /S is 1 /400,
  as recommended by Mr. Wagner, this is identical with Mr. Lawford Fry's proposed
  maximum ratio mentioned above.</small>
  </p><p>
  <small>I would like to know how the figures on Fig. 9 were obtained, because
  they are of very considerable interest. It is also interesting to see the
  efficiencies which Mr. \Vagner has given, for after all, one's own children
  are always much better looking than anyone else's, and I would like to say
  that on my Company's "Royal Scot" engine, on a run in which we reached l,300
  drawbar h.p. and an average speed of about 52 miles, the average boiler thermal
  efficiency is found to be 80½ per cent.</small>
  </p><p align="Justify">
  <small>I have made a tabulated list (see abstract of paper) of boiler proportions
  which are looked upon as fairly satisfactory and efficient. The manufacturing
  question comes in with regard to the first three, because they have the same
  tube plate. We look upon the first boiler; G.7, as probably being the best
  proportioned one, and it will be seen that the ratios for it vary considerably
  from those according to Mr. Wagner's proportions.</small>
  </p><p align="Justify">
  <small>I have also taken the ratio of internal diameter to length for one
  of the boilers guoted by Mr. Wagner and I find that this ratio is 1 to 112,
  somewhat in excess of Mr. Lawford Fry's maximum. I would, however, say that
  I am not at all in favour of tubes 22 feet in length and of the diameter
  given.</small>

  Fowler was born at Evesham, Worcestershire, on 29 July 1870. His father,
  Henry, dealt in furniture, including antiques. The family were Quakers. The
  family enjoyed rowing and celebrated Christmas by swimming in the Avon. He
  was initially educated at the local Grammar School and then attended Mason
  Science College, Birmingham, between 1885 and 1887 and studied metallurgy
  under Professor T. Turner. He served an apprenticeship under J.A.F.
  <a href="#aspinall">Aspinall</a> at Horwich from 1887 to 1891. He then spent
  four years in the Testing Department, working under G.
  <a href="#hughes">Hughes</a>, whom he succeeded as chief of the department.
  From 1895 to 1900 he was Gas Engineer of the LYR, transferring to the MR
  in the same capacity in the latter year. </small>
  </p><p align="justify">
  <small>He was a strict teetotaller, extremely energetic being involved in
  football, cricket and hockey. He could keep goal or wicket with equal facility.
  In his spare time he devoted much of his time to the Boy Scout movement,
  being also keen on cycling and the collection of coins and medals. </small>
  </p><p align="justify">
  <a href="books.htm#radford"><small>Radford: </small></a><small>Henry Fowler
  had joined the Midland Company on June 18, 1900 at a salary of £350
  per annum in the position of Gas Engineer &amp; Chief of the Testing Department,
  from a similar position on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway at Horwich.
  He was to be in just the right place at the right time and reap the full
  fruits of the clash of personalities soon to develop between Deeley and Paget.
  Fowler became Assistant Works Manager on November 1, 1905 in succession to
  Paget. In 1905 he became Assistant Works Manager at Derby, and Works Manager
  in 1907. In 1907 he was sent to North America to study work management. Two
  years later he succeeded Deeley as CME. During World War 1 he was seconded
  to the Ministry of Munitions, being Director of Production from 1915 to 1917
  and then Assistant Director General of Aircraft Production. He was knighted
  in 1918 for his war work.</small>
  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <small>In 1923 he became Deputy CME of the LMS and Mechanical Engineer, Derby,
  succeeding <a href="#hughes">Hughes </a>as CME in October 1925. Although
  notable progress was made in locomotive design under Fowler with the introduction
  of the <i>Royal Scot</i> 4-6-0, the 2-6-4T and the 0-8-0, he failed to exercise
  the technical lead and the strict control needed to overcome traditional
  hostilities and to fuse the CME's department into a unified team.
  <a href="#cox">Cox </a>is especially critical of this period.</small>
  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <small>Fowler had a keen interest in research, particularly in metallurgy.
  Under his influence the LMS sponsored a major investigation into the behaviour
  of copper in fireboxes, and he had a reputation for being expert on aspects
  of boiler materials and design. This interest in research was eventually
  the means whereby he was removed from the post of CME without openly being
  down-graded. In 1930 he was given a new post of Assistant to the Vice-President
  for Works (Research and Development). In this post he pursued his research
  interests for several years to the Company's benefit, and was responsible
  for laying the foundations of the LMS Research Depart ment, which in turn
  formed the basis of the British Railways research organisation. Fowler was
  also interested in training, and maintained close contact with premium
  apprentices and pupils for whom he was nominally responsible.

  had wonderful ideas of his own which he intended to put into practice at

  were being considered one of Sir Nigel's daughters found her father one evening
  on all fours in the family dining-room, squeezing his great bulk through
  the narrow space formed between a wall and a row of chairs, set side by side.
  To his daughter's astonished exclamation, 'What on earth are you doing, father?'
  came the reply, 'If I can get through this, my biggest engineman can' Curiously
  enough, there was a parallel incident in the career of the late Sir Henry
  Fowler, the distinguished C.M.E of the old Midland, and of the L.M.S from
  1928 to 1931,<b> </b>who was in the habit of cycling round Derby Works to
  save time. On entering his office one day his assistant, H.G. Ivatt—son
  of H.A. and later C.M.E of the L.M.S and now of the London Midland
  Region—discovered Sir Henry on the floor endeavouring to get himself
  through the round back of his office chair. When Ivatt expressed his surprise
  Sir Henry explained that he wanted to find out whether or not he could get
  through a certain type of locomotive firehole which happened to be the same
  size as the hole in the back of his chair!</small>
  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <small>Radford tells a similar tale: So far as his employment is concerned,
  he was extremely particular about boilers and fireboxes, being happy if he
  could put on a boiler suit and tinker about. He was easily irritated, but
  this did not last for long, and his usual reply when faced as he was on one
  occasion by an estimate of six months for a new cylinder pattern was "I want
  it in three". And that was the end of the discussion. His tours of the Derby
  Works, while the manager there, were usually&nbsp;made by bicycle, he being
  easily recognisable in his strawyard hat. He would ride around the Shops
  inside and out and if he chanced upon someone committing a misdemeanour he
  would remonstrate with him and then instruct the offender to "clock off"
  and come back on the morrow, punishment indeed in those days of small wages

  <small>Rudgard (Presidential address Instn Loco. Engrs) stated "On the former
  Midland Railway, with which I was particularly associated, a tribute is due
  to the memory of &nbsp;Sir Henry Fowler. His collaboration with Cecil Paget,
  and their understanding of the running shed angle, helped to produce a school
  of design which was pre-eminent amongst all the railways forming the London
  Midland and Scottish in 1923 for reliability and low repair costs, and which,
  continuing under the LMS, lent itself admirably to the introduction of
  developments in motive power practice and organisation; Sir William Stanier
  carried on the good work".</small>
  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <a href="books.htm#westwood"><small>Westwood</small></a><small> considered
  that Henry Fowler was an engineer of all-round ability with (<b>according
  to Westwood</b>) no great talent in any direction. During his terms of office
  new designs were built but these could rarely be called his own designs and
  in some cases were introduced without his genuine approval. As a young man
  he was involved in the early years of automobile engineering, but ... after
  he became Chief Mechanical Engineer, Midland locomotive design seemed to
  stagnate, but this was largely due to the civil engineering department's
  aversion to larger locomotives; double-heading was preferred to track renewal.
  Fowler did, however, build his solitary 0-10-0 for banking on the Lickey
  Incline. After the Railway Amalgamation Fowler became assistant to the chief
  mechanical engineer of the new LMSR (Hughes) until the latter retired. As
  chief mechanical engineer in succession to Hughes, he allowed a kind of
  &nbsp;'Derby imperialism', foisting Midland practice and design on to the
  constituent parts of the LMSR. This was resented, and also meant that the
  Midland 'small engine' policy infected the whole LMSR, Britain's largest
  railway. However, it was one way of promoting standardization, and Midland
  locomotives were very robust and cheap in construction and repair. Fowler's
  proposed 4-6-2 compound, designed to provide the LMSR with a locomotive large
  enough for its needs, was never built. The superintendent of motive power
  (J. <a href="#anderson">Anderson) </a>appears to have been the most potent
  source of opposition to Fowler's proposal; in the end, the LMSR., with scant
  reference to Fowler, ordered the Royal Scot 4-6-0 from the North British
  Locomotive Company instead of accepting Fowler's proposed 4-6-2. The introduction
  of Garratt locomotives also seems to have been more the work of Anderson
  than of Fowler. Among new designs in the Midland tradition of this period
  were 2-6-2 and 2-6-4 tank locomotives, the last being the most successful
  of the Fowler designs. His 0-8-0 was a relative failure, and his proposed
  2-8-2 was never built. The peak of Fowler's career was probably 1914-18,
  when he proved an excellent organizer of munitions production (for which
  he received a knighthood). See: B. Haresnape, <i>Fowler Locomotives
  </i>(1972).</small>

  <b><small>Summary</small></b>
  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <small>From examination of what Sir Henry actually reported it is obvious
  that Fowler has been grossly maligned by history and by E.S. Cox and Hamilton
  Ellis (journalist and painter). Certainly, the birth of the LMS was one of
  the most disastrous corporate events of the twentieth century. In retrospect
  it was absurd to attempt to merge the LNWR and the Midland Railway.
  <a href="/web/20230516165310/https://www.steamindex.com/library/stack/jenkins.htm">Jenkins</a> (footnotes objects to
  this statement, but my KPJ view tends to have hardened with the years and
  should be cast into print) It would have been like bringing the Great Western
  into common ownership with either of these giants. The LNER worked because
  the North Eastern was able to retain sufficient status through its contribution
  to the new company of the brilliant General Manager, Wedgewood, and this
  enabled Gresley to achieve brilliance. The Southern only worked once it became
  a greater South Western (the <i>Lord Nelson </i>was a partial failure or
  success). </small>
  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <small>A structure which would have tolerated autonomy to remain at both
  Crewe and Derby might have worked and such a system was briefly contemplated
  by the LNER. It is probable that both Hughes' and Fowler's reputations might
  have remained unsullied in such a situation. Unfortunately, the Fowler Pacific
  was intended for the WCML, and it might have been almost as good as Stanier's
  earlier attempts: it would certainly have had a less troublesome boiler and
  left on his own Fowler would have gleaned much from Gresley. The negative
  contribution of Anderson requires further research</small>
  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <small>One gets the impression that Fowler was an amiable man with a great
  interest in people, and although (like Collett) he appears to have been less
  interested in locomotive design, although more so than has been given credit)
  he was a considerable engineer with interests in metallurgy, a vital element
  in locomotive design, and in boilers, and it is tragic that
  <a href="/web/20230516165310/https://www.steamindex.com/locotype/fowlerlo.htm#fury"><i>Fury </i>(the high-pressure locomotive
  </a>should have met with disaster due to metallurgical failure of one of
  its tubes. The paper on superheating must have been comparable with Gresley's
  one on high pressure boilers, and this emphasises that Fowler has been badly
  treated by commentators. His comments on George Stephenson are highly perceptive
  and contrast sharply with some of the rubbish written by intellectual minnows.
  Fowler was clearly a brilliant scientific engineer and he must have been
  extremely well-equipped to assess George Stephenson's extraordinary genius.
  He must certainly have been a most likeable man:

  <b><a name="superheating">Superheating</a></b>
  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <small>The following is taken from Cox's <i>Speaking of steam </i>which quotes
  from Fowler's <i>magnus opus</i>: "From the very dawn of locomotive history
  the possibility of superheating was being thought about. . . R. Trevethick
  was the first to apply the system to locomotive engines, and in 1828 he wrote
  that he was building a small locomotive boiler in which he proposed to heat
  the steam in small iron tubes as it passed from the boiler to the cylinder.
  From his patent No 6308 of 1832<b> </b>it is evident that it was his intention
  that these tubes should be placed over the fire itself. . . In 1839, Messrs
  Hawthorn patented a smokebox superheater, while between 1850 and 1870 numerous
  devices were brought out including examples of practically all the types
  which have been experimented with in recent years. .. . It seems to have
  been recognised early that in order to obtain the best results, a fair degree
  of superheat was necessary, but in practice it was found that this led to
  trouble both with the valves and the packing. . . . After 1870 use of superheated
  steam was gradually abandoned and its extensive practical use is a matter
  of very recent date."</small>
  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <small>Fowler went on to state that <a name="schmidt">Dr Wilhelm Schmidt</a>
  began in 1895 to apply to locomotives the knowledge he had gained in the
  use of superheated steam for other purposes, and in 1897 he produced his
  first practical design. His previous experience had indicated that the best
  results were to be looked for in the use of a high degree of superheat, and
  his successful redevelopment of the process was greatly indebted to the practical
  trials carried out by Herr Robert Garbe in charge of motive power on the
  Prussian State Railways. The Schmidt superheater passed through two preliminary
  design phases before it arrived at the form in which it is known all over
  the world today. Originally a nest of superheater elements was situated in
  a vast central tube 1ft 8in diameter connecting firebox to smokebox. Secondly,
  a superheater entirely within the smokebox was devised, the temperature of
  the hot gases as they emerged from the small tubes being supplemented by
  what came out of an additional single large empty tube of 1ft<b> </b>diameter.
  In both these cases the problem of keeping these large tubes tight in the
  tubeplates proved insurmountable and the final manifestation was to divide
  the saturated steam in a header, and pass it down multiple elements placed
  inside a number of flue tubes of approximately 5in diameter, the steam thus
  superheated returning to separate compartments in the header, whence it was
  conveyed by suitable steampipes to the cylinders–the ultimate and basic
  Schmidt lay out.</small>
  </p><p align="JUSTIFY">
  <small>This layout proved so wonderfully flexible in permitting by suitable
  proportions any desired degree of superheat, and relative volume and velocity
  of hot gases issuing into the smokeboxes and was so simple and cheap and
  reliable, that in spite of many intermediate variations by engineers who
  thought they knew better it remained practically unchanged until the last
  days of steam. Not so was the ancillary gadgetry which was at first thought
  necessary for its successful use, nor the designs of valves and piston packing
  which were developed to cope with the high steam temperatures attained. Although
  many attempts were made, some of them partially successful, to retain slide
  valves, use of piston valves became general, and since these bore the brunt
  of the highest temperatures conveyed by the incoming steam, their design
  was critical. Fowler describes the history of the inception of the Schmidt
  wide piston valve ring which was for the first two decades and more in almost
  universal use:</small>

  <small>noted that around 1932 Sir Henry Fowler went to America to see the
  progress made with diesel locomotives there, and on his return decided to
  carry out what must then have appeared to be large scale experiments. Very
  satisfactory and encouraqing results were already being obtained with two
  trial diesel locomotives, the first being the Hunslet 150 h.p. and the second
  a 250 h.p. Armstrong Whitworth diesel-electric type. Then there were the
  early Avonside diesel locomotives. Both these locomotives which had previously
  been on loan were purchased by the LMS and Sir Henry obtained a grant from
  his board of £30,000 tor experimenting with various types of diesel
  locomotive. At the time it seemed a tremendous sum and it certainly bought
  something like ten shunting locomotives, of about the 30-ton mark. It was
  from these early experiments which lasted several years, that the LMS eventually
  standardised on the 50-ton 450 h.p. diesel-electric locomotive for shunting
  purposes, but it has always been his view and still is that the only reason
  the diesel-electric was selected was because in those early experiments all
  the diesel-mechanical units were from 150 to 200 h.p. only, while the
  diesel-electric units were from 250 to 300 h.p. On shunting work and particularly
  on hump shunting and fly shunting on which all the locomotives were tried,
  the larger, heavier and more powerful locomotives were obviously bound to
  be the more useful in moving the traffic. He was quite sure that had it been
  the other way round and had the diesel-mechanical units been the more powerful
  and heavier ones, then they would have prevailed just as easily. As it was,
  the 200 h.p. diesel-mechanical unit was fully proved at that time and ever
  since has more than justified itself, and it is indeed strange that in the
  last 25 years the wheel has turned a full circle and British Railways are
  now using large numbers of 200 h.p. 30-ton diesel-mechanical
  locomotives.</small>
