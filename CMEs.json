Eric Brand Butler-Henderson</b> (26 September 1884 \u2013 18 December 1953) was the seventh child of Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon, and the great-grandfather of Vicki (born 1972) and Charlie Butler-Henderson. He was a soldier and company director, who was honoured when a steam locomotive was named after him.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Biography</h2>\n<p>Born Eric Brand Henderson on 26 September 1884 at Norwood Green in Middlesex, the son of Alexander and Jane Henderson, his father was a stock broker. He was schooled at Eton College. He married Sophia Isabelle Butler Massey (known as Zo\u00eb) on 10 December 1910, and on 21 December 1910 used a deed poll to legally change his name to Eric Brand Butler-Henderson. They had six children: Lionel (born 1911); Patrick (born 1913); Mary (born 1915); Edward (born 1916); Doreen (born 1920); and Kenneth (born 1929).\n</p><p>His eldest son Lionel Butler-Henderson raced cars for Frazer Nash in the 1930s; Lionel's second child Guy (born 1948) raced in the British Karting team; and two of Guy's children, Vicki (born 1972) and Charlie (born 1978), also became accomplished motor racing drivers.\n</p><p>By 1926, Eric Butler-Henderson was living at Winwick Manor, Rugby; in that year he was appointed one of the Sheriffs of Northamptonshire; in 1927 he was again appointed Sheriff for that county, and once again in 1928, but in 1929 was appointed High Sheriff of Northamptonshire.\n</p><p>Eric Butler-Henderson was appointed a Commander of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (C.St.J.) on 20 December 1937.\n</p><p>He died in Andover, Hampshire on 18 December 1953, aged 69.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Army career</h2>\n<p>He was appointed to the Berkshire Imperial Yeomanry (as a second lieutenant) on 30 March 1908 and (when the Territorial Force was formed), transferred to the Berkshire (Hungerford) Yeomanry with a number of other officers on 1 April 1908, retaining his rank. He was promoted to temporary captain on 9 April 1915, and achieved the rank of captain on 20 December 1915. As part of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force he was reported as wounded in 1915. He transferred from the Yeomanry to the Territorial Force Reserve on 6 November 1917, as a captain. He relinquished his Territorial Army Reserve commission on 30 September 1921, retaining his rank of captain but not the right to wear the uniform.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Railways</h2>\n<p>In May 1918, Butler-Henderson was elected a Director of the Great Central Railway (GCR), where his father, Lord Faringdon, was chairman of the board. Like other GCR Directors of the period, he was accorded the honour of having one of the railway's latest express passenger locomotives named after him: no. 506, the first locomotive of GCR Class 11F, was named <i>Butler\u2013Henderson</i> when it entered service on 27 December 1919.\n</p><p>Butler-Henderson was the last new Director of the GCR; at the start of 1923, the GCR amalgamated with several other railways to form the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER), and Butler-Henderson was one of four GCR nominees who became Directors of the LNER, his appointment being confirmed on 17 November 1922. He remained a director of the LNER until at least 1930. Locomotive no. 506 was also inherited by the LNER, and it latterly bore numbers 5506 (from June 1924), 2660 (from October 1946) and finally 62660 (from October 1949). It remained in service with the LNER and its successor, British Railways, until October 1960. After it was withdrawn from service, it was selected for preservation, being restored during 1961. It is part of the National Collection, and as of 25\u00a0November\u00a02009 is on loan to Barrow Hill Engine Shed, where it is on static display.\n</p><p>He was a director of Catalinas Warehouses and Mole Co. Ltd., resigning upon the appointment of liquidators on 27 October 1953.\n</p>\n\n",

Alongside fireman James Nightall, Gimbert was recognised for saving an ammunition train from a fire on 2 June 1944 during the Soham rail disaster.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Early life</h2>\n<p>Gimbert was born on 6 February 1903 in Ely (now in Cambridgeshire), the son of farm labourer George William Gimbert and his wife Florence. He married in 1926 and by 1939 was living in March.\n</p>\n\n<h2>George Cross</h2>\n<p>The citation for the award of Gimbert's George Cross reads:\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>As an ammunition train was pulling into a station in Cambridgeshire, the driver, Gimbert, discovered that the wagon next to the engine was on fire. He immediately drew Nightall's attention to the fire and brought the train to a standstill. By the time the train had stopped the whole of the truck was enveloped in flames and, realising the danger, the driver instructed the fireman to try to uncouple the truck immediately behind the blazing vehicle. Without the slightest hesitation Nightall, although he knew that the truck contained explosives, uncoupled the vehicle and rejoined his driver on the footplate.\n</p><p>The blazing van was close to the station buildings and was obviously liable to endanger life in the village. The driver and fireman realised that it was essential to separate the truck from the remainder of the train and run it into the open. Driver Gimbert set the engine in motion and as he approached a signal box he warned the signalman to stop any trains which were likely to be involved and indicated what he intended to do. Almost immediately the vehicle blew up. Nightall was killed and Gimbert was very severely injured.\n</p><p>\nGimbert and Nightall were fully aware of the contents of the wagon which was on fire and displayed outstanding courage and resource in endeavouring to isolate it. When they discovered that the wagon was on fire they could easily have left the train and sought shelter, but realising that if they did not remove the burning vehicle the whole of the train, which consisted of 51 wagons of explosives, would have blown up, they risked their lives in order to minimise the effect of the fire. There is no doubt that if the whole train had been involved, as it would have been but for the gallant action of the men concerned, there would have been serious loss of life and property.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gimbert was also awarded the Order of Industrial Heroism, a private civil award given by the <i>Daily Herald</i> newspaper, and the LNER's silver medal for Courage and Resource. In 1953 he received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Memorials</h2>\n<p>Gimbert died on 6 May 1976 and was buried in Eastwood Cemetery in March. In 1984, his medals were bought by March Town Council and are on permanent loan to March Museum alongside some shrapnel removed from his body.\n</p><p>On 28 September 1981 two British Rail Class 47 locomotives were named in honour of the two railwaymen: No. 47577 was named \"Benjamin Gimbert, GC\" and No. 47579 \"James Nightall, GC\". The nameplate \"Benjamin Gimbert GC\" was transferred to 47 574 in July 1987 at Stratford depot. It remained on this locomotive for 10 years.  On 2 June 2004 new \"Benjamin Gimbert GC\" nameplates were applied to Class 66 077 at Whitemoor yard (March). Also the Norfolk Green bus company have named Optare Solo 617 (MX55WCV) after Gimbert.\n</p>\n\n",

An A1 Pacific, <i>Flying Scotsman</i>, was the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100\u00a0mph in passenger service, and an A4, No. 4468 <i>Mallard</i>, still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world (126\u00a0mph).\n</p><p>Gresley's engines were considered elegant, both aesthetically and mechanically. His invention of a three-cylinder design with only two sets of Walschaerts valve gear, the Gresley conjugated valve gear, produced smooth running and power at lower cost than would have been achieved with a more conventional three sets of Walschaerts gear.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Biography</h2>\n<p>Gresley was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, during his mother's visit there to see a gynaecologist, but was raised in England at Netherseal, Derbyshire, a member of a cadet branch of a family long seated at Gresley, Derbyshire. After attending school in Sussex and at Marlborough College, Gresley served his apprenticeship at the Crewe works of the London and North Western Railway, afterwards becoming a pupil under John Aspinall at Horwich of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR). After several minor appointments with the L&amp;YR he was made Outdoor Assistant in the Carriage and Wagon Department in 1901; in 1902 he was appointed Assistant Works Manager at Newton Heath depot, and Works Manager the following year.\n</p><p>He became Assistant Superintendent of the Carriage and Wagon Department of the L&amp;YR in 1904 and a year later moved to the Great Northern Railway (GNR) as Carriage and Wagon Superintendent. He succeeded Henry A. Ivatt as CME of the GNR on 1 October 1911. At the 1923 Grouping, he was appointed CME of the newly formed LNER (the post had originally been offered to the ageing John G. Robinson; Robinson declined and suggested the much younger Gresley). \n</p><p>During the 1930s, Sir Nigel Gresley lived at Salisbury Hall, near St Albans in Hertfordshire. Gresley developed an interest in breeding wild birds and ducks in the moat including Mallard ducks. The Hall still exists today as a private residence and is adjacent to the de Havilland Aircraft Museum, with its links to the design of the famous Mosquito aircraft during World War II.\n</p><p>In 1936, Gresley designed the 1,500 V DC locomotives for the proposed electrification of the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield. The Second World War forced the postponement of the project, which was completed in the early 1950s. Edgar Claxton was Gresley's assistant throughout this project, working on power supply, equipment and systems, besides carrying out the trials.\n</p><p>Gresley was appointed CBE in 1920 for services during the First World War and was knighted in the 1936 Birthday Honours by King Edward VIII. Also in the latter year, Gresley was awarded an honorary DSc by Manchester University and presided over the IMechE.\n</p><p>Gresley died on 5 April 1941, after a short illness, and was buried in the Churchyard Extension of St Peter's Church, Netherseal, Derbyshire. At this time, Gresley was serving as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Engineers Railway Staff Corps.\n</p><p>He was succeeded as the LNER CME by Edward Thompson.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Memorials</h2>\n<p>A memorial plaque to Gresley's achievements was unveiled at Edinburgh Waverley railway station in 2001. It was created by the Gresley Society and incorporates line drawings of his <i>Flying Scotsman</i> and <i>Mallard</i> locomotives.\n</p><p>Following the redevelopment of the site previously home to Doncaster College, the square outside the new Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council Offices and Cast Theatre was named Sir Nigel Gresley Square, in honour of the designer of some of the most famous steam locomotives built at Doncaster Plant Works following a public poll of Doncaster residents. Sir Nigel Gresley Square was opened to the public in May 2012 as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, by the Mayor of Doncaster Mr. Peter Davies and two of Nigel Gresley's grandsons.\n</p><p>One A4 class locomotive, no. 4498 <i>Sir Nigel Gresley</i>, was named after its designer. Built in November 1937, it was the one-hundredth Gresley pacific.\n</p><p>A statue of Gresley was unveiled at King's Cross station in London on 5 April 2016, the 75th anniversary of his death. Sculptor Hazel Reeves originally included a duck alongside Gresley in reference to his hobby of breeding water fowl and his bird-themed locomotive names such as <i>Mallard</i>, but this was removed from the final design when two of Gresley's grandsons complained it was \"demeaning\".\n</p><p>The Wetherspoons public house in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, is named <i>The Sir Nigel Gresley</i> in his honour. \n</p><p>He was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame in 2023.\n</p><p>A plaque honouring Gresley was unveiled in the entrance to Doncaster station on 19 June 2025, the 149th anniversary of his birth.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Innovations</h2>\n<ul><li>Derived valve motion for 3-cylinder steam locomotives; Gresley Conjugated Valve Gear.</li>\n<li>The largest passenger steam locomotive in the UK, the P2 2-8-2.</li>\n<li>The largest steam locomotive in the UK, the U1 2-8-0+0-8-2 Garratt locomotive.</li>\n<li>The \"locomotive that won the war\", the V2 2-6-2.</li>\n<li>The first steam locomotive to officially achieve 100 mph, the A3 \"Flying Scotsman\" 4-6-2.</li>\n<li>The fastest steam locomotive in the world, the A4 \"Mallard\" 4-6-2 (126.3\u00a0mph).</li>\n<li>Another A4, \"Silver Link\", previously holding the world speed record for steam locomotives (112\u00a0mph)</li>\n<li>The experimental high-pressure LNER Class W1 \"hush-hush\" 4-6-4 locomotive</li>\n<li>The Silver Jubilee Express</li>\n<li>The articulated railway carriage, first used with some conversions of East Coast Joint Stock (ECJS) carriages in 1907, soon followed by conversions of GNR carriages; new articulated carriages being built for the GNR from 1911.</li>\n<li>The corridor tender to allow longer non-stop running</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Locomotives designed by Gresley</h2>\n<h3>GNR</h3>\n<p><i>See: Locomotives of the Great Northern Railway</i>\n</p>\n<ul><li>GNR 536 Class (LNER Class J6) 0-6-0 (1911)</li>\n<li>GNR Class H2 (LNER Class K1) 2-6-0 (1912)</li>\n<li>GNR Class J21 (LNER Class J2) 0-6-0 (1912)</li>\n<li>GNR Class O1 (LNER Class O3) 2-8-0 (1913)</li>\n<li>GNR Class H3 (LNER Class K2) 2-6-0 (1914)</li>\n<li>GNR Class J23 (LNER Class J51) 0-6-0T (1915)</li>\n<li>GNR Class H4 (LNER Class K3) 2-6-0 (1920)</li>\n<li>GNR Class N2 0-6-2T (1920)</li>\n<li>GNR Class O2 2-8-0 (1921)</li>\n<li>GNR Class J23 (LNER Class J50) 0-6-0T (1922)</li>\n<li>GNR Class A1 4-6-2 (1922)</li></ul>\n\n<h3>LNER</h3>\n<p><i>See: Locomotives of the London and North Eastern Railway</i>\n</p>\n<ul><li>LNER Class P1 2-8-2 (1925)</li>\n<li>LNER Class U1 Garratt 2-8-0+0-8-2 (1925)</li>\n<li>LNER Class J38 0-6-0 (1926)</li>\n<li>LNER Class J39 0-6-0 (1926)</li>\n<li>LNER Class A3 4-6-2 (1927)</li>\n<li>LNER Class D49 4-4-0 (1927)</li>\n<li>LNER Class B17 4-6-0 (1928)</li>\n<li>LNER Class W1 4-6-4 (1929)</li>\n<li>LNER Class V1 2-6-2T (1930)</li>\n<li>LNER Class P2 2-8-2 (1934)</li>\n<li>LNER Class A4 4-6-2 (1935)</li>\n<li>LNER Class V2 2-6-2 (1936)</li>\n<li>LNER Class K4 2-6-0 (1937)</li>\n<li>LNER Class V3 2-6-2T (1939)</li>\n<li>LNER Class V4 2-6-2 (1941)</li>\n<li>LNER No. 6701 Bo+Bo electric locomotive (1941)</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Arms</h2>\n",

He rose up the ranks of LNER and continued his career under British Rail (BR) after nationalisation. In the 1956 New Year Honours list, he was awarded the MBE. At that time the Assistant Motive Power Superintendent of the Eastern Region of British Railways. By the 1960s, when BR was withdrawing steam locomotives and dismantling facilities for them, Miller was one of several people who provided support to Alan Pegler in his attempts to run the preserved <i>Flying Scotsman</i>.\n</p><p>He was appointed Chief Engineer (Traction &amp; Rolling Stock) in 1968. It was in this position that Miller was credited with instigating the development of the InterCity 125, known as the High Speed Train (HST). At the time, BR was focused on developing an electric Advanced Passenger Train (APT), but by 1969 the APT project was significantly behind schedule. As a stop-gap measure, engineers devised plans for a 125-mile-per-hour (200\u00a0km/h) \"High Speed Diesel Train\", which Miller submitted to the British Railways Board (BRB) at the beginning of 1969; the submission won the endorsement of Henry Johnson, chairman of BRB. The HSDT eventually became the InterCity 125, introduced into service from 1975. Although the HST was intended to fill in for the APT, the APT project was eventually abandoned and it wasn't until 2017 that the first were withdrawn.\n</p><p>Miller retired in 1973, three years before the HST entered service.

Nightall was a London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) fireman on a 51-wagon ammunition train driven by Benjamin Gimbert. When a wagon caught fire, Nightall helped Gimbert uncouple it from the rest of the train in order to allow Gimbert to tow the burning wagon away from the rest of the ammunition wagons on the train. The wagon exploded after being towed a distance of 140 yards (130\u00a0m), killing Nightall instantly, but preventing a chain reaction in the other wagons. The explosion blew a twenty-foot crater in the track, destroyed Soham railway station, and damaged 600 buildings in the village. Gimbert, who survived the conflagration, was also awarded the George Cross and Order of Industrial Heroism.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Early life</h2>\n<p>Nightall was born in Littleport Isle of Ely (now Cambridgeshire), England, on 20 May 1922. He was the son of Walter Nightall, a labourer, and Alice Nightall.\n</p><p>He had a fiancee when he died, Edna Belson.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<p>The citation for the award of the George Cross read:\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"templatequote\"><p>As an ammunition train was pulling into a station in Cambridgeshire, the driver, Gimbert, discovered that the wagon next to the engine was on fire. He immediately drew Nightall's attention to the fire and brought the train to a standstill. By the time the train had stopped the whole of the truck was enveloped in flames and, realizing the danger, the driver instructed the fireman to try to uncouple the truck immediately behind the blazing vehicle. Without the slightest hesitation Nightall, although he knew that the truck contained explosives, uncoupled the vehicle and rejoined his driver on the footplate.\n</p><p>The blazing van was close to the station buildings and was obviously liable to endanger life in the village. The driver and fireman realized that it was essential to separate the truck from the remainder of the train and run it into the open. Driver Gimbert set the engine in motion and as he approached a signal box he warned the signalman to stop any trains which were likely to be involved and indicated what he intended to do. Almost immediately the vehicle blew up. Nightall was killed and Gimbert was very severely injured.\n</p><p>\nGimbert and Nightall were fully aware of the contents of the wagon which was on fire and displayed outstanding courage and resource in endeavouring to isolate it. When they discovered that the wagon was on fire they could easily have left the train and sought shelter, but realizing that if they did not remove the burning vehicle the whole of the train, which consisted of 51 wagons of explosives, would have blown up, they risked their lives in order to minimize the effect of the fire. There is no doubt that if the whole train had been involved, as it would have been but for the gallant action of the men concerned, there would have been serious loss of life and property.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nightall was also awarded the Order of Industrial Heroism and the LNER gallantry medal.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Memorials</h2>\n<p>On 28 September 1981 two Class 47 locomotives were named in honour of the two railwaymen: No. 47577 was named \"Benjamin Gimbert, GC\" and No. 47579 \"James Nightall, GC\".\nThe nameplate \"James Nightall G.C\" was removed in November 1995.

                "text": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Arthur Henry Peppercorn</b>,  (29 January 1889 \u2013 3 March 1951) was an English railway engineer, and was the last Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the London and North Eastern Railway.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Career</h2>\n<p>Arthur Peppercorn was born in Leominster in 1889 and educated at Hereford Cathedral School. In 1905 he started his career as an apprentice with the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at Doncaster. Then CME Nigel Gresley took a liking to the young apprentice and would supervise his career; in turn, Peppercorn was devoted to Gresley, and would in time be treated almost like one of the family.\n</p><p>Gresley's sudden death in 1941 was a shock to all in the LNER, and although Peppercorn was considered for the role, his great modesty in comparison with that of the other candidate, Edward Thompson, as well as the influence Thompson held within the LNER seniority meant that it was Thompson who succeeded Gresley. Thompson was already 60 years old, and both he and the LNER recognised that his appointment was not a permanent solution: both Peppercorn and Harrison were ready in the wings.\n</p><p>When Peppercorn did succeed Thompson as CME on 1 July 1946, his style of work proved to be very different from that of his predecessor. Peppercorn was recognised as an amiable and very well liked man, though despite his popularity, he remained very modest and humble. He believed the job was above him, but in truth he possessed much of the outstanding ability of his mentor Sir Nigel Gresley. He could see beyond the limitations of the Gresley conjugated valve gear and the flaws surrounding the Thompson locomotives. Peppercorn finished several projects which were started by Thompson and cancelled others. He revised the K1/1 design to build a batch of 70 class K1s, continued the building of the B1s, and halted further rebuilding of the A10 class into A1/1 specification. His most significant mark on railway history must be his LNER Peppercorn Class A1 and the LNER Peppercorn Class A2.\n</p><p>Peppercorn died in 1951 in Doncaster.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Locomotives</h3>\n<p>Edward Thompson had set down strict guidelines for the incoming CME, relating directly to the upcoming design of an Express Passenger Pacific. The design was to draw heavily on the A1/1 Pacific <i>Great Northern</i> which had been rebuilt during Thompson's time in office. This would have created a cross between the A2/3 Pacifics, and <i>Great Northern</i><span>'</span>s 6 ft 8 in driving wheels. By the time Peppercorn was in office, reports of <i>Great Northern</i><span>'</span>s persistent frame problems, hot axleboxes and steam leaks were all filtering back into the design office. The belief was that the problems were caused by a lack of frame support at the front end, largely due to the cylinders not being aligned with each other (an aspect of divided drive combined with equal length connecting rods). Thompson's guidelines would have produced another locomotive with the cylinders apart, so Peppercorn decided against it, and brought the cylinders in line, and arranged the locomotive as something of a merging of both Gresley's A4 and Thompson's A2/1, creating first the A2 class, and then the A1.\n</p><p>Both of the Peppercorn Pacifics used a boiler incorporating a 50 sq ft grate, allowing for very high power levels to be produced, but at the cost of a relatively high fuel consumption. A consequence was that although both the A1 and A2 classes were regarded as excellent locomotives they were not especially popular with those who had to fire them. Previous Gresley Pacifics on the LNER had a 41.25 sq ft grate, which had proved sufficient for any tasks not needing very high power output. The P2s had been built with 50 sq ft grates, which were able to supply large quantities of steam for long periods, but had proved too big for the purpose: the fireman had to feed vast amounts of coal just to keep the grate covered, where a smaller grate would have sufficed. The P2 boiler was carried over to the Thompson Pacifics (because the first were rebuilds of P2s) and then on to the Peppercorn Pacifics. At the time these classes were built however, the trainloads of WW2 were massive in comparison to those for which the Gresley Pacifics had been designed and built, and both Peppercorn and Thompson had to design engines which could meet that requirement: heavier fuel consumption on lighter duties was a compromise which was needed in order to meet the higher demands of the day.\n</p><p>Despite the fuel consumption concerns, in addressing the limitations of both the Thompson Pacifics and those of Gresley, Peppercorn had produced engines which could master virtually all the work put to them without the drawbacks of centre big-end bearing overheat, leaking steam pipe connections, frame fractures or any of the other flaws which blighted the previous LNER Pacifics. The A1s were intended to take over from the A4s on non-stop express duties, but the low fuel consumption of the A4s  meant that the A1s failed to dent their monopoly on the non-stop expresses. After post-war frame alignment and fitting of double Kylchap blastpipes, the A4s became once more the standard-bearer of the East Coast Main Line. For the second tier LNER Expresses however, the A1s proved to be an excellent design.\n</p><p>The real strength of the A1 and A2 classes lay in their reliability. By carefully incorporating the best of Gresley and Thompson design, as well as ideas of his own, Peppercorn had produced two masterpieces of durability and low service cost. Five of the A1s had roller bearings fitted throughout, and they regularly covered 150,000 miles between intermediate overhauls. Even the plain bearing A1s were capable of 90,000 miles between overhauls, and no other express passenger locomotive class in the UK could do more than 80,000. The first of his A2 engines had single chimneys, and when fitted with self-cleaning smoke-boxes experienced steaming problems which took some time to resolve. Changing to double blast-pipe resolved much of the issues, though some of the A2s retained single chimney without self-cleaning apparatus. The A1s, being built afterwards, and incorporating the lessons learned, featured the double blast-pipe and chimney from new.\n</p><p>These were known as some of the best British steam locomotives ever in service. The A2s were particularly powerful, and finally produced the answer to the heavy services on the Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line which had blighted both Gresley (P2 Class- too long a rigid wheelbase) and Thompson (A2/2 and A2/3- both lacking adhesion). Upon nationalisation and the creation of British Railways, Peppercorn continued in essentially the same job, now titled \"Chief Mechanical Engineer, Eastern and North Eastern Regions\". He retired at the end of 1949, one year after nationalisation: he was Chief Mechanical Engineer for three and a half years.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Legacy</h2>\n<p>K1 locomotive No. 62005 was preserved by NELPG, though originally to provide spares for No. 61994 <i>The Great Marquess</i>. 62005 was eventually rebuilt in its own right, and has seen regular active main line service for the last 40 years.\n</p><p>Only one of his famous Pacific locomotives, an A2, 60532 <i>Blue Peter</i>, was preserved.\n</p><p>No A1s were preserved. However, a brand new example, 60163 <i>Tornado</i>, was built as the next in the class. It moved under its own steam for the first time in August 2008.\n</p><p>Arthur Peppercorn's widow, Dorothy Mather, was honorary president of the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, builder of <i>Tornado</i>, from the early 1990s until her death in 2015. At age 92, she lit the first fire in <i>Tornado's</i> firebox in January 2008, and was later on the footplate for <i>Tornado's</i> inaugural steaming at Darlington works, stating \"My husband would be proud.\"\n</p>\n\n",

Edward Thompson was born at Marlborough, Wiltshire on 25 June 1881. He was the son of Francis Thompson, assistant master at Marlborough College. He was educated at Marlborough before taking the Mechanical Science Tripos at Pembroke College, Cambridge, earning a third class degree. Thompson entered the railway scene after education, contrasting that of his predecessor Nigel Gresley, who had also attended Marlborough after gaining practical experience as a pupil at Horwich Works.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Biography</h2>\n<p>Edward Thompson was born in Marlborough, Wiltshire to Francis Thompson. His grandfather Francis ran a tailoring business in London. \n</p><p>He would be educated at Marlborough College, same as his predecessor. After education at Marlborough, he would attend Pembroke College and be influenced by Sir George Stokes, ultimately graduating with a third class degree. \n</p>\n\n<h3>Pre-grouping Career</h3>\n<p>After graduation Thompson worked in both industry and the railways for a while. He worked as a pupil at Beyer, Peacock's drawing office, before moving to work at the Midland Railway's Derby shed. By 1910 he was assistant divisional locomotive superintendent on the North Eastern Railway (NER), in which capacity he gave evidence at the inquiry into the fatal accident between two goods trains at Darlington on 15 November 1910. In 1912 he was appointed Carriage and Wagon Superintendent at Doncaster for the Great Northern Railway (GNR). He served in the British Army during the First World War, and was twice mentioned in dispatches, and awarded OBE, Military Division for action at the Battle of Passchendaele. \n</p><p>Upon demobilisation, he returned to the railways, alternating between the wagon works at Darlington and Doncaster, and consequently between the North Eastern and Great Northern respectively. In 1920 he returned to the NER at York as Carriage and Wagon Superintendent, and joined the LNER upon grouping. He became Workshop Manager at Stratford Works in 1930 and was able to make significant improvements although the works layout prevented major changes there. He would become a Mechanical Engineer at Darlington and Doncaster in 1934 and 1938 respectively, before becoming Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1941 after the death of Nigel Gresley.\n</p><p>Edward Thompson would marry Guendolen Raven, daughter of Sir Vincent Raven, CME of the North Eastern Railway. After Guen's death in 1938, he subsequently became very lonely.\n</p><p>During World War Two, he met Richard Hardy by chance, who was working on the footplate of a locomotive without permission. He was fond of the boy and the two boarded a train to Doncaster, where Thompson spoke to him with great enthusiasm about ongoing projects. Richard Hardy would join the LNER and become part of Thompson's design team.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Wartime CME</h3>\n<p>When Thompson was appointed CME of the LNER, he became in charge of a railway which had a greatly reduced labour force and foundry capacity. To remedy this, he sought to start a much needed standardisation programme out of an urgent need for simplicity. The LNER was continuing to operate almost 5,000 locomotives across 160 classes from pre-grouping companies, many of which were aging and unreliable. He intended to reduce the number of locomotive classes from 160 to just 19 classes by scrapping or removing most of the pre-grouping era locomotives of the LNER. Some believed that in doing so, he intended to \"rid the LNER of Gresley\", when in reality he sought to retain most of his predecessor's work.\n</p><p>The standardisation was a further reflection on the difference between Gresley and Thompson. The LNER had never been in a position to undergo large-scale re-equipment programmes such as those afforded by the LMS, and for much of its existence, the LNER used a large fleet of pre-grouping locomotives for everything except the very top-flight services. As such, Gresley believed that rebuilding and improving was usually enough in a lot of cases, and where it was not, he designed a locomotive specifically for the job. Examples of each are the D16/3 Claud Hamiltons (rebuilt), the B12/3 (re-boilered and new valve gear) and his K4 (built for the West Highland Line) and P2 (for the Aberdeen to Edinburgh route). Thompson instead advocated for constructing and maintaining a small variety of classes, and spent time during his tenure as CME in developing a list of classes either to be maintained (A10, A3, A4 etc.), rebuilt to his standard (B2, A2/2, K1/1 etc.) or built to new standard designs (B1, L1 etc.).\n</p><p>The programme had the desired effect of reducing the variety of LNER classes, and allowed the withdrawal of a number of elderly and worn out pre-grouping Atlantics, 4-6-0 and more. However, the number of locomotive classes and boilers did not change significantly until after he had left office. While his goals are correct, his short time in office limited the successes that he may have.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Retirement and death</h3>\n<p>Edward Thompson retired in June 1946 at the age of 65 after holding the post for five years and was succeeded by Arthur Peppercorn. The first locomotive of his final design, the A2/3, entered traffic on 24 May and was named after its designer, coincidentally as the 2,000th engine constructed at Doncaster. At the naming ceremony, Sir Ronald Matthews paid tribute to the departing CME, thanking him for his service to the company through difficult wartime situation.\n</p><p>After retirement, he would regularly attend the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, the MCC and the Oxford and Cambridge University Club at Pall Mall.He would attend lectures at IME, but did not comment, research or present papers himself. He maintained his friendship with other CMEs, such as William Stanier, both of which congratulated each other over new locomotives such as their respective mixed traffic designs, his successor Arthur Peppercorn and former colleague and CME of the Southern Railway Oliver Bulleid, the four together attending the opening of the Rugby Locomotive Testing Station in 1948. He continued to have an interest in the railway scene, taking an interest in British Railways' standardisation scheme developing under Robert Riddles, which mirrored his own ideas and changes implemented during the war. Members of his team, such as Edward Windle, would join the engineering team at BR.\n</p><p>He died during the night of 14 July 1954 in North Wales, having suffered from severe chest pains. His funeral was held by the Church of England with no friends or relatives present in accordance to his wishes. Most of his estate was passed to his surviving sister and some to his friends.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Thompson's designs</h2>\n<h3>Pacifics</h3>\n<p>Thompson rebuilt a select number of Gresley locomotives that were problematic and had low availability, in addition to attempting to design his own locomotives based on Gresley designs. While Thompson was critical of some of Gresley's design practices, he continued with some design features such as the use of a double Kylchap exhaust and large smokeboxes and his predecessor's influence was still visible in his design. Thompson's Pacific locomotives all retained three cylinders, but with divided drive and 3 independent sets of Walschaerts valve gear rather than Gresley's own valve gear design. The outside cylinders were placed behind the front bogie with the inside cylinder well forward, giving his Pacific locomotives an elongated look which was not commonly seen on the LNER. \n</p><p>Claims of Thompson's locomotive underperforming suggests that his designs failed in multiple aspects, with accusations including excessive wheel slip, frame fractures, going against LNER practice and requiring more maintenance. However, Simon A.C. Martin has found no evidence suggesting that they were considered as failures and in cases, contrary to popular claims, found that they were capable and reliable locomotives. While Thompson's Pacifics may have slipped more than other Pacific types on the LNER network due to a poorer weight distribution with a longer frontend, all Pacific locomotives are prone to wheelslip, with Bulleid's Pacifics being just as, if not more infamous for their wheel slip. Thompson also instituted a different maintenance regime for his locomotives where they would be shopped more often for smaller repairs and prevent issues from cascading into major accidents.\n</p><p>Despite some faults, Thompson's Pacifics were well designed and retained the ability for high speed running, being able to hold speed in excess of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), with design features such as the steam circuit carrying over into Arthur Peppercorn's designs. Peppercorn's A2 design was a further development of Thompson's A2/3 design, which itself was a development of the A2/2 rebuilt from Gresley P2s. Under Arthur Peppercorn, some of Thompson's locomotives were fitted with boilers to Peppercorn's design, reviving the \"banjo dome\" featured on Gresley locomotives.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Class B1</h3>\n<p>Thompson's most successful design was the two-cylinder mixed traffic Class B1 4-6-0. The LNER did not have a general purpose mixed traffic engine, such as the highly successful GWR Hall Class or the LMS Stanier 5MT Black Fives. The B1 was based loosely on Gresley's class B17 but omitted the third inside cylinder. The cylinders used were from Gresley's H3/K2 Class and the boiler was a standard 5 ft 6 in diameter No. 2 boiler. The layout was simplified for easier maintenance and more effective wartime running. \n</p><p>The first batch of the Class B1 was authorised in mid-1942, totaling ten with the first being a prototype for further testing. No. 8301 would be frequented by Thompson while under construction, who would ride on the footplate on its first day of operations. It would be named <i>Springbok</i> out of respect for the visiting Jan Smuts and South African soldiers. Testing of the B1 would continue well into 1944, comparing it to other locomotives to be replaced. The design proved to be free-steaming, economical and simple to maintain. Construction of the Class B1 was slow beyond the first member, and it took until June 1944 for the other nine members to be completed. More than 400 B1s were built between 1946 and 1952, with British Railways continuing B1 production after nationalisation. Up to 409 B1s were available at any time as one was written off and not replaced after an accident.\n</p><p>The Thompson B1 equaled the LMS Black Five locomotives during the inter-regional exchange trials in the first year of British Railways. Robert Riddles, who would come to design the range of British Railways Standard Classes, praised the B1 for its capability.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Class L1</h3>\n<p>Thompson's Class L1 were developed due to a demand from the running department for a modern version of the Metropolitan Railway K class which were reaching the end of their lives. While Gresley V1 and V3 locomotives were available, they were deemed insufficient. It was ordered in large numbers to serve across the LNER's system as a part of the standardisation scheme. It used an uprated boiler based on the V3 with larger fireboxes and water tanks and B1 cylinders and 5\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (1.57\u00a0m) wheels. Testing under George Musgrave showed they steamed well, had a good reserve of power and accelerated quickly. \n</p><p>Initially thirty were ordered and all emerged by 1948. An additional seventy were ordered from North British Locomotive Company and Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorn and delivered to British Railways. Only when in widespread service did problems with overheating axleboxes appear. Experiments to solve these problems were unsuccessful and the L1s finished their working lives without much modifications or reaching their true potential.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Other rebuilds</h4>\n<p>The Robinson Class Q4 0-8-0 tender engines were one of the first to be rebuilt by Thompson. Having reached the end of their service life by the late 1930s, most of the class were due to be scrapped. However, with wartime restricting new build locomotives and in need of more powerful shunting engines, Thompson opted to rebuild the design into a tank engine. Most of the old engine, such as the cylinders, motion and boiler, were reused, producing the Thompson Q1, although modifications were made to accommodate an enclosed cab, and the initial 1,500 gallon side tanks were later upgraded to hold 2,000 gallons of water.\n</p><p>In 1942, Thompson rebuilt the Robinson Class J11 and Gresley D49/2 No.365 <i>The Morpeth</i>. The J11/3 was not visually distinct from its original condition, but was modified with new cylinders, valve gears and valve motion, requiring modifications to the engine frames, boiler and chimney. The rebuilding had the desired effect and another thirty were converted, but most of the class remained in their as built condition. The Gresley D49/2 were fitted with Lentz rotary valve gear, but trials proved the piston valve D49/1 to be superior and the D49/2 were due to be converted, save No. 365 <i>The Morperth</i> which was fitted with rotary cam shaft valve gear controlled by steam pressure in 1939. With the camshaft damaged in 1941 and placed in store, Thompson modified it to return it to service. It was rebuilt with two inside cylinders with Stephenson motion, an arrangement similar to the Robinson Class D11. Although Thompson featured the modified locomotive in his standardisation plans, after trials showed little increase in performance or reliability, the experiment was not repeated and no longer pursued.\n</p><p>To boost the amount of available mixed traffic 4-6-0 engines in traffic, Thompson proposed the rebuilding of the Robinson Class B3. The engines were not particularly successful and had heavy coal consumption, and under Gresley had their valve gear replaced with Caprotti valve gear. In 1943, No. 6166 <i>Earl Haig</i> was awaiting repairs for its cracked cylinders, and was selected for rebuilding. Again, most of the engine was retained, with a new diagram 100A boiler and outside Walschaerts valve gear fitted, designated the B3/3. It performed well but suffered from cracked frames, and no more were rebuilt, with <i>Earl Haig</i> being the last of the six members of the class to be withdrawn.\n</p><p>The LNER Class O4 was a heavy goods design originating from the First World War, and the LNER continued to operate a large number of them. While some have already been rebuilt under Gresley, Thompson sought to use them as part of his standardisation scheme. Retaining the frames and wheels, the boiler, cylinders, cab and running plate was modified to create the class O1. Some, where the condition of the cylinders permitted, would not undergo the rather extensive reconstruction and were simply fitted with new cabs and boiler to become the O4/8 subclass.\n</p><p>A total of 30 Gresley B17 would be rebuilt to form the B2, with two examples becoming the designated engines for hauling Royal Trains. LNER Class K4 No. 3445 <i>MacCailin Mor</i> had its middle cylinder removed, becoming the prototype of the Peppercorn Class K1, designated the K1/1. Similarly, a K3 had its middle cylinder removed to become the K5, easing maintenance.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Coach design</h3>\n<p>Thompson improved passenger safety by introducing steel-bodied coaches to the LNER. Previously the LNER had Gresley-designed coaches, the most famous of which had teak bodies but by 1940s standards these were considered insufficiently safe in a collision. Therefore, during the Second World War Thompson designed new all-steel coaches that became a forerunner of British Railways Mark 1 design.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Controversy</h2>\n<h3>Thompson VS Gresley</h3>\n<p>It has been suggested that the two can be considered as rivals. Had the grouping not taken place, Thompson was in line to become the Chief Mechanical Engineer on the North Eastern Railway, and perhaps even the LNER itself. Given the rivalry between the Great Northern Railway and North Eastern Railway and Gresley's disagreements with Sir Vincent Raven, CME of the NER and father-in-law to Thompson, this may not have been a far-fetched interpretation of Thompson's actions during the war years.\n</p><p>In reality, Thompson's view on Gresley is quoted as \u201cthe greatest British locomotive engineer since Churchward\u201d. However, he also recognised Gresley's single-mindedness in putting design before everything else, such as his specialisation of rolling stock maintenance. It is clear, despite the differences in engineering opinion and approach, Thompson greatly admired Gresley, hoping to refine his predecessor's work. Bert Spencer remarks that Thompson introduced many changes to improve productivity, whereas Gresley and Bulleid placed their attention on locomotive design.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Thompson as CME</h3>\n<p>Some have claimed that the LNER board of directors had no immediate successor in mind, and went to various railway companies to seek a suitable replacement. Simon A.C. Martin however, in analyzing the LNER board notes of the time, found no evidence supporting this claim. Engineers that are said to have been approached included Southern Railway's CME and former colleague Oliver Bulleid, J.F. Harrison, who would go on to design the <i>Duke of Gloucester</i>, fellow Gresley assistant and Thompson's own successor Arthur Peppercorn or future railway historian E.S. Cox. Such tales regarding Peppercorn often suggest that Thompson used his seniority and political experience to sidestep Peppercorn.\n</p><p>The LNER board of directors had discussed upcoming potential appointments, seen through board minutes going back to the 1930s, and there are no such notes for discussion on the role of CME, even with Gresley reaching retirement age by the end of 1941. While this can be interpreted in several ways, an interpretation is that it is expected that Edward Thompson would take over the CME position due to his experience in maintaining locomotive and rolling stock. \n</p><p>In 1939, the LNER board formed what became to known as the Emergency Board in order to guide the railway through the war. The board consisted of the directors, stakeholders in addition to engineers and government representatives. Six months before his death, Gresley fell increasingly ill and failed to attend some of the board meetings, instead sending Edward Thompson, Arthur Peppercorn, occasionally J.F. Harrison or a combination of two out of the three. During the meetings, Thompson was acting in the CME position and Peppercorn as the assistant to the CME. According to LNER board minute 2823, 23 days after Sir Nigel Gresley's passing, the LNER Emergency Board recorded their loss of the great engineer, and in the same meeting, appointed Edward Thompson as CME. The LNER was aware that they had a well-rounded engineer in Thompson who could take over in the interim and lead the LNER through the difficult war time conditions.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Rebuilding Gresley's Locomotives</h3>\n<p>Thompson disagreed with Gresley on multiple things, and the biggest disagreement between the two would surround the Gresley conjugated valve gear for three-cylinder engines. This valve gear arrangement worked well during peacetime but experienced problems due to poor maintenance during the Second World War, giving Thompson justification for his criticism of the design. Thompson himself described the conjugated valve gear as Gresley's only real failure, but noted that Gresley himself would not admit to any failure in his own work.\n</p><p>Thompson would present the LNER board with an internal report in 1942 on the development, construction and maintenance of locomotives. He approached Sir William Stanier for a report on the conjugated valve gear fleet, who deputised the report to E.S. Cox. They were shown around LNER locomotive works and parts of the valve gear were presented for inspection. The report was written by Cox and signed off by Stanier, dated 8 June 1942 and titled \"'Report on the \"2 to 1\" Gresley Valve gear on L.N.E.R 3-cylinder locomotives'\". In the report, Cox was critical of the valve gear which was more prone to failure in wartime conditions and provided three broad recommendations: To stop building three-cylinder locomotives with conjugated valve gear; To rebuild some of the conjugated locomotives to have three sets of valve gear experimentally; and to modify the existing fleet to remedy the failure-prone middle big end. \n</p><p>With World War Two significantly reducing available manpower for maintenance and the necessary skills for maintaining the valve gear, Thompson received approval from the board to rebuild some of the more problematic members of Gresley's designs. As a class of six non-identical steam locomotives, the P2 class have been a cause of concern as to their low annual mileage and availability when compared to other Gresley Pacifics. Other problems of the class included crank axle failures at low speed, overheating axle boxes, high fuel consumption, cracking at joints in the frames all whilst causing track spreading on the Edinburgh-Aberdeen mainline. Having sent the rebuilt W1 4-6-4 locomotive to work with and be compared against the P2 Mikados in Scotland in 1942, the one-off experimental was found to be equally capable in pulling trains on the Edinburgh-Aberdeen mainline, giving credence to the idea that six-coupled locomotives could replace the six non-standard locomotives. \n</p><p>Thompson proceeded to first experimentally rebuild No. 2005 <i>Thane of Fife</i> as it had the lowest annual mileage and was reputedly the worst of the P2s. The rebuilt locomotive emerged partway through 1943 and achieved 45,732 miles by the end of the year, significantly outperforming the P2s. Arthur Peppercorn presented the board with a report on the operation of the rebuilt locomotive with great praise, and the board approved the rebuilding for the remaining five members. The rebuilds would become some of the best performing locomotives with high mileage and availability.\n</p><p>Later, E.S. Cox, who wrote the report arguing against the use of the Gresley Conjugated valve gear, would suggest that Thompson's rebuilding programme was intended to rid the LNER of Gresley's legacy. Such a claim would be repeated until modern day, but is backed with little evidence. In addition, despite other CMEs also rebuilding their predecessor's work, only Thompson's rebuilding programme attracted such a high level of attention and scrutiny, despite similar reasoning.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Great Northern</h3>\n<p>Perhaps Thompson's greatest controversy was his decision to rebuild the pioneer of the Gresley A1 class <i>Great Northern</i> to his (Thompson's) design. Some have blamed Thompson for letting his personal feelings towards Gresley cloud his judgement. In reality, the selection of locomotive was not the CME's decision and was made by the Locomotive Running Superintendent and verified by LNER Finance Department. Such a decision would have been made based on the proposed locomotive's age, total mileage to date, mileage since its last shopping and overall condition. As the first Gresley Pacific, <i>Great Northern</i> had been in service since 1922 and was also in the Doncaster workshop at the time, hence it was possibly selected out of expediency. \n</p><p>The design of the locomotive still retained Gresley design features, including the Diagram No. 107 boiler also used on A4s, the double Kylchap chimney and draughting arrangements, and externally still resembled a Gresley locomotive. Thompson adopted divided drive on the middle cylinder and had to move the leading wheels forward to accommodate the middle cylinders. The resulting locomotive was by no means a failure, contrary to claims of its poor performance. It was reliable and achieved high mileage, becoming the highest mileage Thompson Pacific by the time of its withdrawal, rivalling Gresley A4s and Peppercorn A1s. \n</p><p>Part of the controversy likely stemmed from the loss of the name <i>Great Northern</i> and Thompson's misreading of the sentiment towards the locomotive. Thompson did not like naming engines, and was furious when first of his B1 locomotive No. 8301 was named <i>Springbok</i> in honour of a visit by Jan Smuts. Similarly, when <i>Thane of Fife</i> and other P2 locomotives were rebuilt and entered traffic, their nameplates were not fitted. After entering traffic, <i>Thane of Fife</i> underwent extensive comparative testing on the Scottish section of the LNER against the yet-to-be rebuilt P2s, after which nameplates would be fitted again. However, the damage was done. \n</p><p>Many staff who worked under Gresley and Thompson were from the GNR, and may have feared the loss of the name that represented their origin in addition to the role of the first Gresley Pacific <i>Great Northern</i> in ushering in a new era of glamour and innovation for locomotive design. Thompson may also have intended the pioneer of the Gresley Pacifics to also become the flagship of his own locomotive designs, however his early retirement and Peppercorn's return to conventional design practices meant that his locomotives looked out of place when compared to both his predecessor and successor's engines.\n</p><p>Given LNER staff and railway enthusiasts' sentiment towards <i>Great Northern</i>, the distinct design choices of the rebuilt locomotive and the role of the locomotive in locomotive design within the LNER, it is perhaps unsurprising to see Thompson disliked by both his subordinates and enthusiasts.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Locomotives designed by Edward Thompson</h2>\n<p><i>See: Locomotives of the London and North Eastern Railway#Thompson_designs</i>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Thompson A1/1 4-6-2 (1945)</li>\n<li>Thompson A2/1 4-6-2 (1944)</li>\n<li>Thompson A2/2 4-6-2 (1943)</li>\n<li>Thompson A2/3 4-6-2 (1946)</li>\n<li>Thompson B1 4-6-0 (1942)</li>\n<li>Thompson B3/3 4-6-0 (1943)</li>\n<li>Thompson B16/3 4-6-0 (1944)</li>\n<li>Thompson B2 4-6-0 (1945)</li>\n<li>Thompson K1/1 2-6-0 (1945)</li>\n<li>Thompson K5 2-6-0 (1945)</li>\n<li>Thompson L1 2-6-4T (1945)</li>\n<li>Thompson O1 2-8-0 (1944)</li>\n<li>Thompson Q1 0-8-0 (1942)</li></ul>\n\n",

His elder brother was Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood. He was educated at Clifton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a member of the Cambridge Apostles. He was close friends there with his second cousin, Ralph Vaughan Williams, who later dedicated two of his works to him, \"In the Fen Country\" and \"A Sea Symphony\". Along with Richard Curle, Wedgwood was executor of Joseph Conrad's estate from Conrad's death in 1924 until 1944, when responsibility was transferred to the author's son John Conrad and the law firm Withers.\n</p><p>After graduating, Wedgwood was recruited by Sir George Gibb to the North Eastern Railway. After a period of general training, he was appointed Assistant Dock Superintendent at West Hartlepool from 1 May 1900, at a salary of \u00a3250 per annum. Two years later he was appointed District Superintendent at Middlesbrough, and was promoted to Divisional Goods &amp; Mineral Manager, Newcastle, in 1905. When Eric Geddes became Deputy General Manager in 1912, Wedgwood succeeded him as Chief Goods Manager. After war service with the Ministry of Munitions (when he held the rank of Brigadier-General) he returned to the North Eastern Railway in 1919 as Deputy General Manager. When Sir Alexander Kaye Butterworth retired, Wedgwood succeeded him as General Manager for the last year of the NER's existence, and was selected as Chief General Manager of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway from its formation on 1 January 1923. Wedgwood was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1917, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1918. He was knighted on 10 July 1924 and created a baronet on 20 January 1942.\n</p><p>He married Iris Veronica Pawson, daughter of Albert Henry Pawson on 24 October 1906 at St. Margaret's, Westminster. They had two children who survived to adulthood; John Hamilton Wedgwood (1907\u20131989), second baronet and Cicely Veronica Wedgwood (1910\u20131997), historian.

He served as the Unionist MP for Richmond (Yorkshire) from 1918 to 1929.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Life</h2>\n<p>He was born at Cliffe Hall, the son of Col. John Gerald Wilson CB and his wife Angelina Rosa Geraldine O'Brien. His father was an officer in the York and Lancaster Regiment, and died of wounds during the Second Boer War, at the Battle of Tweebosch. Murrough Wilson was one of seven children, and the second-oldest of four brothers. The oldest brother, Lt. Richard Bassett Wilson, was also killed in the Boer War, at Rustenburg. The third brother, Lt.-Col. Denis Daly Wilson MC, was killed in action in France during the First World War, while the fourth brother, Capt. Sir Frank O'Brien Wilson, was a Royal Navy officer and later a member of the Legislative Council of Kenya.\n</p><p>Educated at Marlborough College, Wilson joined the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1893, and by 1912 was a director at the company. An officer with the 2nd/5th Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment during the First World War, he was elected to parliament at the 1918 general election, which, as the first after the conclusion of the war, was considered a \"khaki\" election. Wilson, who stood as a Unionist for the Yorkshire constituency of Richmond, was one of the flood of Coalition MPs elected, although he was replacing a fellow Conservative, William Orde-Powlett (later Lord Bolton). He was elected unopposed at the following three general elections, in 1922, 1923, and 1924, but left parliament prior to the 1929 election. His successor, Thomas Dugdale (later Lord Crathorne), held the seat for the next 30 years.\n</p><p>Maintaining his directorship of the NER throughout the war, Wilson continued as a director after the formation of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. From 1924, he was chairman of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes, for which he was knighted in 1927. A Deputy Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire in later life, he was also a director of the Yorkshire Insurance Company (now part of Aviva), and later sat on the board of the London Electricity Board. Wilson had succeeded his father as lord of Cliffe Hall, and died there in 1946, aged 70. He was described in his obituary in <i>The Times</i> as a \"great Yorkshireman, very well known throughout the whole county\", and had earlier succeeded the 3rd Baron Grimthorpe as president of the Society of Yorkshiremen in London.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Family</h2>\n<p>Wilson married in 1904 Sybil May Milbank, a daughter of Sir Powlett Milbank, 2nd Baronet, in 1904, with whom he had four children.
